# Traffic-Density-Detection-on-IDD-Dataset
Built an end-to-end traffic object detection pipeline by fine-tuning YOLOv8 on the IDD (IIIT-Hyderabad) dataset. Implemented dataset conversion (XML→YOLO), automated splitting, custom training in Google Colab, and robust inference workflows. The model detects multiple vehicle and road-user classes to support traffic density estimation and analysis.
